* * * * * * * * * * *

NMRangeSlider is custom iOS control that gives you a UISlider like UI for selecting a range of values.

The range slider can be configured using a set of images in much the same way as UISlider. (Background, Track and Thumbs)

In addition to the regular UISlider features it can:

* Handle stepped values. The handles will snap to points along the slider with a couple different options
* Access to the centre location of handle image. This can be used to arrange subviews.

See the demo application for some examples on how the to configure the slider.
